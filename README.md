# Process-Mining
Exploring pm4py's capabilities for correctness analysis and process reconstruction.

In this work, a business process is loaded, which is converted into a Petri net. 
Then the event log is generated. A marker reachability graph is constructed. 
There is a preliminary analysis of the event log and a defect-free analysis. 
To get an initial idea of what the processes “look like”, it is useful to visualize 
the events associated with each case over a (relative) time period using scatter plots. 
The model is reconstructed from the event log using the Alpha algorithm, Heuristic and Induction. 
The quality of the reconstruction is assessed using token-based and alignment-based metrics.
